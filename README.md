# Kanban-board
A Kanban board is a way of organizing and viewing your team's work that emphasizes an ability to see many different tasks at once and how they relate to one another, which is especially useful for project managers and team leads. Each task is usually shown in a box — known as a "card" — with a brief description of the work. It is usually preferred to have just one task per card to keep things simple. Each card is then usually shown in a grid with different columns; each column representing different stages of completion of the task, such as in progress, under review, done, etc.
